3)What are the critical Permissions and Normal Permissions? 
What are the examples of each?

answer:-NORMAL PERMISSIONS

Many permissions are designated as PROTECTION_NORMAL, which indicates that there's no great risk to the user's privacy or 
security in letting apps have those permissions. For example, users would reasonably want to know whether an app can read their 
contact information, so users have to grant this permission explicitly. By contrast, there's no great risk in allowing an app to 
vibrate the device, so that permission is designated as normal.

If an app declares in its manifest that it needs a normal permission, the system automatically grants the app that permission at 
install time. The system does not prompt the user to grant normal permissions, and users cannot revoke these permissions.

As of API level 23, the following permissions are classified as PROTECTION_NORMAL:

ACCESS_LOCATION_EXTRA_COMMANDS
ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY
ACCESS_WIFI_STATE
BLUETOOTH
BLUETOOTH_ADMIN
BROADCAST_STICKY
CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE
CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE
CHANGE_WIFI_STATE
DISABLE_KEYGUARD
EXPAND_STATUS_BAR
GET_PACKAGE_SIZE
INSTALL_SHORTCUT

To protect the system's integrity and the user's privacy, Android runs each app in a limited access sandbox. 
If the app wants to use resources or information outside of its sandbox, the app has to explicitly request permission. 
Depending on the type of permission the app requests, the system may grant the permission automatically, or the system may
 ask the user to grant the permission.
