2)For how long the data resides in the cache?
answer:-
It depends much on person, browser and settings.
Browser usually reserves certain amount of disk space, like 12 MiB, to this task. If user stopped using browser it is indefinitely. 
If (s)he uses browser rarely it will be until the expiration - either by internal policy or by HTTP headers. 
If (s)he uses browser heavily it can be 12 minutes or even less.
I believe that it is hard to say 'in general' as I had a website on which 50% entries were from Firefox and 
49% from Opera when IE at that point had over 75% of market. If target of your side are users who uses browser heavily it can
 be very short. On the other hand if your site is only website visited it can be nearly never.
Depends on how long the server specifies. The server sends back parameters in response header.
 They can specify max-age (how long to cache the file before it expires in milliseconds) or an 
expiration date (date that the file will expire). If it has both, max-age will take priority.
